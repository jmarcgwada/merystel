    "reasoning": "This design focuses on providing a secure and scalable structure for the Zenith POS application, emphasizing authorization independence and clarity. User profiles and company data are stored in dedicated collections with clear ownership patterns.\n\n**Authorization Independence:** The design avoids hierarchical authorization dependencies by ensuring that access control information is readily available within each document or collection. For example, the User document contains a `companyId` field, enabling rules to verify company membership without needing to perform a `get()` operation on the Company document.\n\n**QAPs Support:** Segregation is used extensively. User profiles are stored under `/users/{uid}`, providing a clear and secure path-based ownership model. Company data is stored in a top-level `/companies/{companyId}` collection. This segregation ensures secure `list` operations because rules can easily filter based on the user's identity or company affiliation without inspecting the contents of each document (Rules Are Not Filters).\n\n**User Profiles:** User profiles are stored under `/users/{uid}`, where `{uid}` corresponds to the Firebase Authentication UID. This path-based ownership ensures that only the authenticated user can access and modify their profile data. The User document includes a `companyId` for association with a company.\n\n**Company Data:** Company data is stored in a top-level `/companies/{companyId}` collection, where `{companyId}` is the unique identifier for the company. This segregation allows for easy management of company-specific settings and data.\n\n**Customer Data:** Customer data is stored under `/companies/{companyId}/customers/{customerId}`, creating a Company 1:N Customer relationship. This structure allows for easy listing and filtering of customers belonging to a specific company. The Customer document also contains a `companyId` (denormalized) for rule evaluation and authorization independence."
