/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for Zenith POS.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a multi-tenant security model where companies have isolated data.
 * Users can only access data within their assigned company. Access is further restricted by user roles (admin, manager, cashier).
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores individual user profiles.
 * - /companies/{companyId}: Stores company-level data.
 * - All other collections are nested under /companies/{companyId} to ensure data isolation.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Users can only read their own profile data. Listing all users is disallowed.
 * - Company data is accessible to all authenticated users within that company.
 * - Most company subcollections are accessible based on the user's role within the company.
 * - The rules do NOT validate the full schema of the data for rapid prototyping, but they DO enforce critical relationships (e.g., companyId).
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * The `User` document includes a `companyId` and `role` field. These are CRITICAL for authorization
 * and avoid the need for complex queries or additional reads.
