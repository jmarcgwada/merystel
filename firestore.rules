/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for Zenith POS.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict company-based data isolation model. All data
 * is scoped to a specific company, and users must be authenticated and
 * associated with a company to access its data.  User listing is disallowed.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores individual user profiles.  Writeable by the user, readable by admins.
 * - /companies/{companyId}: Stores company-level data.  Writeable by admins.
 * - /companies/{companyId}/{collection}/{documentId}:  All other collections are nested under a company.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - No public data access is permitted without authentication.
 * - Only authenticated users can access data.
 * - Data access is restricted to the company the user is associated with.
 * - Users can only create their own user document.
 * - Users cannot list all user documents.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 *  - The `User` entity has a `companyId` field. This field is CRITICAL.  It is
 *    validated on user creation and is immutable thereafter to ensure
 *    that a user cannot change their company association.
 *
 *  - All company-owned documents are secured by verifying that the `companyId`
 *    in the path matches the user's `companyId`.
 *
 * Structural Segregation:
 *  - All company-specific data is stored under the /companies/{companyId} path,
 *    ensuring clear separation and preventing accidental cross-company data access.
