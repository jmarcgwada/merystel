/**
 * @fileOverview Firestore Security Rules for Zenith POS.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for user profiles and uses company-based access control for company and customer data.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores individual user profiles, accessible only by the user themselves.
 * - /companies/{companyId}: Stores company information, accessible to company administrators (not yet implemented).
 * - /companies/{companyId}/customers/{customerId}: Stores customer data for a specific company. Access is controlled by company membership.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User profiles are strictly private; only the authenticated user can read or write their own profile.
 * - Listing users is disallowed to prevent information leakage.
 * - The rules are designed to be authorization-independent, avoiding `get()` calls by denormalizing `companyId` where needed.
