/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for Zenith POS.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict data ownership model. Users can only
 * access their own user document. All company-related data is accessible
 * only to authenticated users and writes are implicitly trusted since this is a Prototyping phase.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: User profile information.
 * - /companies/{companyId}: Company root data.
 * - /companies/{companyId}/{collection}/{docId}: Data related to a company, such as customers,
 *   suppliers, items, etc.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Users can only read and write their own user document.
 * - Listing users is not allowed.
 * - Company-specific data is implicitly trusted for writes in the Prototyping phase, meaning all authenticated users can modify company data.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 *  None. Write access to the `companies` collections is implicitly trusted during prototyping, so denormalization is not needed.
 *
 * Structural Segregation:
 *  The application uses structural segregation by storing private user data under `/users/{userId}`
 *  and company-specific data under `/companies/{companyId}`.
