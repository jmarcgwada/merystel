/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for Zenith POS.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict company-based data isolation model. All data
 * is nested under /companies/{companyId}, and access is generally restricted
 * to users who belong to that company. User profiles themselves are stored
 * separately under /users/{userId} and are accessible only to the user themselves.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: User profile information (private).
 * - /companies/{companyId}: Company-level data (e.g., settings).
 * - /companies/{companyId}/customers/{customerId}: Customers of the company.
 * - /companies/{companyId}/suppliers/{supplierId}: Suppliers of the company.
 * - /companies/{companyId}/categories/{categoryId}: Item categories.
 * - /companies/{companyId}/items/{itemId}: Sellable items.
 * - /companies/{companyId}/tables/{tableId}: Restaurant tables.
 * - /companies/{companyId}/sales/{saleId}: Sales records.
 * - /companies/{companyId}/paymentMethods/{methodId}: Payment methods.
 * - /companies/{companyId}/vatRates/{vatId}: VAT rates.
 * - /companies/{companyId}/heldOrders/{orderId}: Held orders.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User listing is disallowed.
 * - Company listing is disallowed.
 * - Default security posture is strict owner-only access unless otherwise specified.
 * - Data validation is minimal in this prototyping phase, focusing on authorization.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 *  - It is assumed that any document that requires company-level authorization
 *    will contain a `companyId` field that matches the parent path. This is
 *    validated on `create` operations and enforced as immutable on `update` operations.
