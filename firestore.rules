/**
 * @file Firebase Security Rules for Zenith POS.
 *
 * @core_philosophy This ruleset employs a strict user-ownership and company-based access control model.
 *  - Users can only manage their own profile data.
 *  - Companies serve as data silos; users within a company have access to company-specific data.
 * @data_structure
 *  - User profiles are stored under `/users/{userId}`.
 *  - Company data is stored under `/companies/{companyId}`, with subcollections for customers, categories, etc.
 * @key_security_decisions
 *  - Listing of all users is disallowed to prevent information disclosure.
 * @denormalization_for_authorization
 *  - Company ID is included in the user profile to simplify company-based data access rules.
