/**
 * @file Firebase Security Rules for Zenith POS.
 *
 * @core_philosophy This ruleset prioritizes ease of development and data access.
 *   - All authenticated users can create customers, items, and all other entities.
 *   - Only admins can create users.
 *
 * @data_structure
 *   - /users/{userId}: Stores individual user profiles.
 *   - /companies/{companyId}: Root-level collection for company-wide data.
 *   - /companies/{companyId}/*: All other data is nested under a specific company.
 *
 * @key_security_decisions
 *   - Users cannot list all users (only admins can create them).
 *   - All collections under a company are readable by all users.
