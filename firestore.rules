/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for the Zenith POS application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for user profiles,
 * and restricts access to company and customer data based on company affiliation.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores user profile information, accessible only by the user.
 * - /companies/{companyId}: Stores company data. Access control not fully specified in the IR.
 * - /companies/{companyId}/customers/{customerId}: Stores customer data, accessible by associated company.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User listing is implicitly disallowed (no `allow list` rule for `/users`).
 * - The rules enforce that a user can only create, update, or delete their own profile data.
 * - Customer access is restricted based on the `companyId` and company administrators.
 * - These rules prioritize authorization and relational integrity, with flexible data shapes for prototyping.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - The `Customer` entity includes a `companyId` field, which is denormalized from the parent `/companies/{companyId}` path. This allows for efficient authorization checks without requiring `get()` calls to the parent document.
