/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for Zenith POS.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict data ownership model. Users can only
 * read and write their own profile data. All company-related data is
 * accessible only to authenticated users associated with that specific
 * company. This prevents unauthorized access and ensures data privacy.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores individual user profiles. Access is restricted
 *   to the user themselves.
 * - /companies/{companyId}: Stores company-level data. Access to this
 *   root and all subcollections is restricted to users belonging to that
 *   company.
 * - /companies/{companyId}/customers/{customerId}: Customer data for a company.
 * - /companies/{companyId}/suppliers/{supplierId}: Supplier data for a company.
 * - /companies/{companyId}/categories/{categoryId}: Item categories for a company.
 * - /companies/{companyId}/items/{itemId}: Sellable items for a company.
 * - /companies/{companyId}/tables/{tableId}: Restaurant tables for a company.
 * - /companies/{companyId}/sales/{saleId}: Completed sales, invoices, quotes, etc.
 * - /companies/{companyId}/paymentMethods/{methodId}: Payment methods.
 * - /companies/{companyId}/vatRates/{vatId}: VAT rates.
 * - /companies/{companyId}/heldOrders/{orderId}: Temporarily held orders.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User listing is disallowed to protect user privacy.
 * - All company-related data is implicitly private and requires authentication.
 * - No public data access is allowed.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 *  - The `User` entity contains a `companyId` field. This field is
 *    crucial for authorizing access to company-specific resources.
 *    Rules will check if `request.auth.uid` matches the `userId`
 *    and if the user's `companyId` matches the requested company's ID.
