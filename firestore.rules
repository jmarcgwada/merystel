/**
 * @file Firestore Security Rules
 * @version 2
 *
 * @corePhilosophy
 * This ruleset enforces a multi-tenant security model where data is segregated by company.
 * Users can only access data belonging to their company. Users have owner access to their own user document.
 * Public listing is disabled for sensitive collections.
 *
 * @dataStructure
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores individual user profiles, accessible only by the user themselves.
 * - /companies/{companyId}: Stores company-level data. All data related to a company is nested under this path.
 * - /companies/{companyId}/...: Contains collections like customers, suppliers, items, etc., scoped to the company.
 *
 * @keySecurityDecisions
 * - Users can only read and write their own user document.
 * - All company-related data access is implicitly restricted to authenticated users.
 * - Public listing of suppliers is denied.
