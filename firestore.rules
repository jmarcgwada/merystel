/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for Zenith POS.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for user profiles and
 * company-owned data segregation. Each company's data is isolated, and users
 * can only access data associated with their company. Authorization decisions
 * are made based on the authenticated user's UID and their associated company ID.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores user profiles. Access is restricted to the user themselves.
 * - /companies/{companyId}: Stores company-level data. No direct user access.
 * - /companies/{companyId}/...: All company-specific data is nested under the
 *   company document.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Users can only read and write their own profile data.
 * - Listing of users is disallowed.
 * - All data within a company is implicitly restricted to users belonging to that company.
 * - In the absence of schema ownership fields, access is denied except for public read.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 *  For simpler rules and to avoid costly `get()` operations, the `companyId`
 *  is included in the User document. This allows us to quickly verify if a
 *  user has access to a specific company's data.
 *
 * Structural Segregation:
 *  Private user data is stored under `/users/{userId}`, while company-specific data is
 *  stored under `/companies/{companyId}/...`. This ensures clear separation and
 *  prevents accidental exposure of sensitive information.
