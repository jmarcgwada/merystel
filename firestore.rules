/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for Zenith POS.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for user profiles
 * and company-based ownership for other data.  A user can only manage their
 * own profile data.  All other data (customers, suppliers, items, etc.)
 * is managed at the company level, and all authenticated users of the system
 * are assumed to have sufficient privileges to manage data within their
 * assigned company.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores individual user profiles.
 * - /companies/{companyId}: Stores company-level data.
 * - All other collections are nested under a specific company document.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Users can only read/write their own user document.
 * - Listing users is not permitted.
 * - Company-level data is accessible to all authenticated users.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 *  To improve rule performance and security, the `User` document contains
 *  a `companyId` field. This allows rules to quickly check which company
 *  a user belongs to, avoiding expensive queries.
