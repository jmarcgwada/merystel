/**
 * @file Firestore Security Rules
 * @core-philosophy This ruleset enforces a hierarchical data ownership model.
 *  Each company owns its data (customers, items, etc.). Users have profiles under /users/{userId}.
 *  Access is generally restricted to authenticated users and company members.
 * @data-structure
 *  - /users/{userId}: User profiles.
 *  - /companies/{companyId}: Company root documents.
 *  - /companies/{companyId}/{collections}: Company-owned data (customers, items, etc.).
 * @key-security-decisions
 *  - Users can only read/write their own profile.
 *  - Company data is generally accessible to authenticated users.
 *  - Listing of users is disallowed.
 *  - Flexible data validation is enabled for rapid prototyping.
