/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for Zenith POS.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a company-centric data model, where most data is scoped to a specific company.
 * Users can only access data associated with their company. User profiles are self-managed.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores individual user profiles, accessible only by the user themselves.
 * - /companies/{companyId}: Root document for each company.
 * - /companies/{companyId}/{collections}: All other data (customers, items, sales, etc.) are stored
 *   as subcollections under the company document.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Users can only read and write their own user document.
 * - Listing all users is disallowed.
 * - All company-related data requires the user to be authenticated.
 * - Data validation is relaxed in this prototyping phase to allow rapid schema iteration,
 *   focusing instead on authorization.
 * - Assumes a `companyId` field exists on user profiles to link them to a company.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * The `User` document must contain a `companyId` field, and the user's `id` must match the `userId`
 * in the path `/users/{userId}`. This allows secure association between users and companies
 * and avoids the need for complex queries in the rules.
